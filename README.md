  --See READ-ME
 
# Explain:
 
 A very simple tool that encrypts files in a given folder on the pendrive connected to a Rasberry-Pi and decrypts them too while pouting relevant notifications over an attached OLED.
 The connections between the Adafruit OLED and the R-Pi(in our case, model zero) are done using an I2C interface.
