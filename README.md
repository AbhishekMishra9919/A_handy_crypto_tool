# A_handy_crypto_tool_for_Rpi
  --See READ-ME
 
# Explain:
 
 A very simple tool that encrypts files in a given folder on the pendrive connected to a Rasberry-Pi and decrypts them too while pouting relevant notifications over an attached OLED.
 The connections between the Adafruit OLED and the R-Pi(in our case, model zero) are done using an I2C interface.  
 
 The file must be executed using 
 
 -- python3 Tool.py

# Dependencies
  Download pyAesCrypt, Adafruit-GPI and RPI-gPIO for this project. Suggested to use pip3.
